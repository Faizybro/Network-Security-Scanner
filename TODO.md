# TODO: Network Security Scanner & Firewall Visualizer

## Project Setup
- [x] Create project directory structure (network_security_scanner)
- [x] Create requirements.txt with dependencies
- [x] Create app.py (Flask backend with scanning and firewall simulation routes)
- [x] Create templates/index.html (Frontend HTML with forms and results)
- [x] Create static/style.css (CSS for UI styling)
- [x] Create static/script.js (JavaScript for AJAX and DOM updates)

## Implementation
- [x] Implement backend scanning functionality using python-nmap
- [x] Implement firewall simulation logic (add rules, simulate traffic)
- [x] Build frontend UI with forms and result displays
- [x] Add basic visualization (table for results, list for rules and simulation)

## Testing and Integration
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Run the Flask app locally
- [x] Test scanning functionality (Note: nmap executable not installed via choco, scanning will fail)
- [x] Test firewall simulation
- [x] Test frontend-backend integration in browser (app running at http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- [x] Ensure app runs without errors

## Followup
- [ ] Verify all features work as expected
- [ ] Add any enhancements if needed (e.g., better visualization)
